Bloxy HID Peripheral

This project implements a Bluetooth HID peripheral (keyboard + mouse) using BlueZ and D‚ÄëBus on Linux.
It is split into two main components:

‚Ä¢ Daemon (daemon/): Runs headless, registers the HID GATT service with BlueZ, tracks evdev input, builds HID reports, and exposes a custom D‚ÄëBus API.
‚Ä¢ UI Client (ui/): A curses‚Äëbased console interface that connects to the daemon over D‚ÄëBus. It lets you inspect services, characteristics, descriptors, and toggle features in real time.


---

üöÄ Getting Started

Requirements

‚Ä¢ Linux with BlueZ and D‚ÄëBus
‚Ä¢ Python 3.9+
‚Ä¢ Root/sudo access (for BLE + evdev input devices)


Installation

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y bluetooth bluez python3-dbus python3-gi python3-evdev python3-yaml python3-venv


Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/meehog527/Bloxy.git
cd Bloxy


Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configuration

‚Ä¢ Edit peripheral.yaml to define your GATT services/characteristics.
‚Ä¢ Edit report_map.yaml to map evdev key codes to HID usage IDs.
‚Ä¢ Update /etc/bluetooth/main.conf similar to bluez/main.conf.


Running the Daemon

Foreground run:

sudo -E env PYTHONPATH=. python3 daemon/hid_daemon.py


As a systemd service:

sudo cp systemd/hid-peripheral.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp systemd/env /etc/default/hid-peripheral
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now hid-peripheral


Running the UI

SSH into the device and run:

python3 ui/console_ui.py


The curses UI will show live HID state, let you toggle the peripheral, and drill into services/characteristics.

üß© Architecture Overview

Module Responsibilities

‚Ä¢ daemon/hid_daemon.py
Entry point. Loads configs, builds services, polls evdev, updates HID reports, and exposes the custom D‚ÄëBus API.
‚Ä¢ daemon/ble_peripheral.py
Implements BlueZ GATT objects (HIDService, HIDCharacteristic, HIDDescriptor).
‚Ä¢ daemon/hid_reports.py
Builds HID keyboard/mouse reports from evdev events using report_map.yaml.
‚Ä¢ daemon/evdev_tracker.py
Tracks pressed keys, mouse buttons, and relative movement from /dev/input/eventX.
‚Ä¢ daemon/dbus_utils.py
Constants and helpers for BlueZ D‚ÄëBus registration.
‚Ä¢ ui/status_client.py
Connects to the daemon‚Äôs D‚ÄëBus API, fetches status JSON, sends control commands.
‚Ä¢ ui/console_ui.py
Curses‚Äëbased dashboard. Navigates services/characteristics, shows live values, toggles notifications.

üîÑ Data Flow

1. Input: evdev devices ‚Üí evdev_tracker.py ‚Üí pressed keys/buttons.
2. Report Building: hid_reports.py ‚Üí HID reports.
3. Peripheral: ble_peripheral.py ‚Üí updates GATT characteristics.
4. Daemon: hid_daemon.py ‚Üí orchestrates, exposes D‚ÄëBus API.
5. BlueZ: sends notifications to connected Bluetooth host.
6. UI: console_ui.py connects via status_client.py to daemon‚Äôs D‚ÄëBus API for inspection and control.

üñ•Ô∏è Typical Workflow

‚Ä¢ Daemon runs headless as a systemd service.
‚Ä¢ You SSH into the Pi and run ui/console_ui.py.
‚Ä¢ The UI shows live HID state (e.g., pressing A updates the keyboard report value).
‚Ä¢ You can drill into services/characteristics, toggle notifications, or stop/start the peripheral.

That‚Äôs the raw Markdown text ‚Äî ready to paste into GitHub as README.md. Would you like me to also append a ‚ÄúUpdating the Project‚Äù section that documents the update script (full vs partial update) so it‚Äôs all in one place?
